h1. Information System Designer

Information System Designer provides a set of tools to help you in the design and the development of applications. It brings a complete development environment based on and integrated to Eclipse. This product features graphical modelers (Database, SOA, Entity, etc.) fully integrated to Eclipse. 

Each of these modelers provides ready-to-use diagram editors that allow you to create, edit and visualize model elements.
You can easily modify these editors with Obeo Designer to adapt each diagram to your needs or combine it to your own DSL. 

h2. Database Designer

Database Designer is a graphical modeler to define or edit relational tables and relations. It's a simplified version of the Merise language.
It is composed of the MPD diagram (Data Physical Model) to specify the design of your schema. The MLD (Data Logical Model) is simplified by using logical types instead of database vendor specific types. For the MCD (Data Conceptual Model), you can use the Entity Designer.
You can define:
* Schemas
* Tables
* Columns
* SQL Datatypes (in MLD: logical types, in MPD: database vendor specific types)
* Primary and Foreign Keys
* Etc.

h2. Graal Designer

Graal Designer provides to analysts and agile product owners the ability to specify the users needs and their interactions with a system.
The Graal methodology allows the modeling of business systems by focusing on the user needs and his interactions with the system. By analyzing the tasks a user should be able to perform, the Graal methodology allows the analyst to define tasks, use cases, user stories and interaction aspects a system should offer.
Graal is well adapted for product owners in SCRUM methodology, as it provides specifications easily understandable by non IT users.
This module uses a dedicated Graal metamodel and implements the following diagrams:
* Tasks graph
* Action plan
* Use cases
* Actors
* User stories
* Layers to indentify tasks related to selected user stories

h2. Cinematic Designer

Cinematic Designer allows the modeling of UI navigation by focusing on the description of Scenario, Flow, Transitions, Actions / Events, and the content of each screens with Widgets.
This module uses a dedicated Cinematic metamodel and implements the following diagrams:

* Flow Diagram
* UI Structure
* Layers to activate View Containers or Flow Events
